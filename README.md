# Travel Guide

This website is a travel guide where users can preview popular travel destinations and read other people's reviews and recommendations. Users can add desired destinations to their own planner and send it to whichever e-mail they provide. They can subscribe to newsletter as well.
This is a responsive website created in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS for my own educational purposes.

The website can be found on the following link: https://travel-guide-ee.000webhostapp.com
